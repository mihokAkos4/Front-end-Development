const App = () => {
  return(
    <AppContext.Provider>
      <ComponentA />
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ComponentA = React.memo(() => <ComponentB />);
const ComponentB = () => <ComponentC />;
const ComponentC = () => null;


If the App component re-rendered for whatever reason, what would be the sequence of component re-renders that would take place?

-->When App re-renders, only App re-renders—none of its children (ComponentA, ComponentB, ComponentC)
	 will re-render in this specific case.


useMemo

React hook that allows you to keep the same object reference in memory
and prevent unnecessary re-renders if the object itself hasn’t changed any values
